console.log("hello world")

//variables declaration 
const accountId = 13345;

var accountPassword = "nishchal321";
city = "jhumka";



// var is not used generally since it is not braces scoped so we are not allowed to use same variable throughout the code without affecting eachother ;
/* so we use let instead of var */
// variable can  be declared without any keyword as well like in example city 
//if we just declared a variable wthout assigning it an value it has undefined as default value
