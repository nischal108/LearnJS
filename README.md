# JavaScript Learning Phase Repository

Welcome to my JavaScript learning journey! This repository is dedicated to storing all the code snippets, exercises, and projects I work on during my learning phase of JavaScript.

## Introduction

In this repository, you will find code examples and small projects that I've implemented as part of my learning process in JavaScript. 
These may include basic concepts, algorithms, and hands-on exercises.

Learning is a continuous journey, and I'll be updating this repository as I progress.


Happy coding!
